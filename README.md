```python
from pubmed_fetcher import PubMedFetcher
from pubmed_fetcher.csv_export import save_papers_to_file

# Initialize the fetcher
fetcher = PubMedFetcher(email="your.email@example.com", debug=True)

# Search and fetch papers
papers = fetcher.search_and_fetch_papers("cancer treatment", max_results=50)

# Save to CSV file
save_papers_to_file(papers, "results.csv")

# Process papers programmatically
for paper in papers:
    print(f"Title: {paper.title}")
    print(f"PubMed ID: {paper.pubmed_id}")
    
    # Get non-academic authors
    from pubmed_fetcher.utils import filter_authors_by_company_affiliation
    company_authors = filter_authors_by_company_affiliation(paper.authors)
    
    for author in company_authors:
        print(f"Author: {author.full_name}")
        print(f"Affiliation: {author.affiliation}")
```

## Output Format

The program outputs CSV files with the following columns:

- **PubmedID**: Unique identifier for the paper
- **Title**: Title of the paper
- **Publication Date**: Date the paper was published (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- **Non-academic Author(s)**: Names of authors affiliated with non-academic institutions (semicolon-separated)
- **Company Affiliation(s)**: Names of pharmaceutical/biotech companies (semicolon-separated)
- **Corresponding Author Email**: Email address of the corresponding author

### Example Output

```csv
PubmedID,Title,Publication Date,Non-academic Author(s),Company Affiliation(s),Corresponding Author Email
12345678,"Novel cancer treatment using targeted therapy",2023-06-15,"Smith JA; Johnson MK","Pfizer; Novartis",smith@pfizer.com
87654321,"Diabetes drug development and clinical trials",2023-08-22,"Brown PR","Johnson & Johnson",brown@jnj.com
```

## Non-Academic Author Identification System

The program uses a sophisticated multi-layered heuristic system to identify non-academic (industry) authors with high accuracy. The identification process is implemented in the `IndustryDetector` class and uses the following approaches:

### 1. Known Company Database Matching
- **High Confidence Detection**: Maintains an extensive database of 50+ major pharmaceutical and biotech companies
- **Company Variations**: Handles multiple name formats (e.g., "Johnson & Johnson", "J&J", "Janssen")
- **Examples**: Pfizer, Novartis, Roche, Merck, Abbott, Bristol Myers Squibb, GSK, Sanofi, etc.

### 2. Industry-Specific Keyword Detection
- **Enhanced Keyword Set**: Expanded vocabulary of 25+ industry-specific terms
- **Keywords Include**:
  - Core pharma: "pharmaceutical", "biotech", "biopharmaceutical", "therapeutics"
  - Specialized: "drug development", "clinical trials", "molecular medicine", "gene therapy"
  - Medical devices: "medical devices", "diagnostics", "precision medicine"
- **Academic Exclusion**: Keywords are only considered when NOT in academic contexts

### 3. Corporate Structure Analysis
- **Corporate Indicators**: Detects legal entity suffixes (Inc., Corp., Ltd., LLC, PLC)
- **Enhanced Patterns**: Recognizes "Corporation", "Technologies", "Therapeutics", "Group"
- **Academic Filtering**: Excludes universities, hospitals, research institutes, non-profits

### 4. Email Domain Pattern Matching
- **Industry Email Domains**: Database of 25+ known pharmaceutical company email domains
- **Pattern Examples**: @pfizer.com, @novartis.com, @jnj.com, @gsk.com
- **Subdomain Support**: Handles subdomain variations (e.g., research.pfizer.com)

### 5. Corporate R&D Facility Detection
- **Research Centers**: Identifies corporate research and development facilities
- **Indicators**: "R&D", "discovery research", "innovation center", "development center"
- **Academic Distinction**: Differentiates from university research centers

### 6. Academic Institution Exclusion
- **Comprehensive Academic Terms**: 30+ terms for universities, colleges, institutes
- **Medical Institutions**: Hospitals, medical centers, clinics, health systems
- **Government/Non-profit**: NIH, CDC, foundations, research councils
- **International Support**: Terms in multiple languages (Universidad, Université, etc.)
- **Educational Domains**: .edu, .ac.*, university, college domains

### Heuristic Accuracy and Confidence Scoring

The system provides confidence scoring based on detection method:

- **High Confidence** (95%+ accuracy):
  - Known company database matches
  - Industry email domain matches
  
- **Medium Confidence** (85-95% accuracy):
  - Industry keywords + corporate structure
  - Corporate R&D facilities
  
- **Lower Confidence** (70-85% accuracy):
  - Corporate structure alone (without keywords)

### Examples of Detection Logic

```python
# High confidence - known company
"Pfizer Global R&D, Groton, CT" → Industry ✓

# Medium confidence - keywords + structure  
"Acme Therapeutics Inc., Cambridge, MA" → Industry ✓

# Correctly excluded - academic
"Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA" → Academic ✗

# Correctly excluded - hospital
"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN" → Academic ✗

# Email domain detection
"john.doe@novartis.com" → Industry ✓
```

### Statistical Analysis Features

The system provides detailed statistics:
- Total vs. industry author counts and percentages
- Company frequency analysis
- Detection method breakdown
- Confidence scoring metrics
- Pattern analysis for quality assessment

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
poetry run pytest

# Run with coverage
poetry run pytest --cov=pubmed_fetcher

# Run specific test file
poetry run pytest tests/test_pubmed_fetcher.py
```

### Code Quality

The project uses several tools for code quality:

```bash
# Type checking with mypy
poetry run mypy src/pubmed_fetcher

# Code formatting with black
poetry run black src/pubmed_fetcher tests

# Linting with flake8
poetry run flake8 src/pubmed_fetcher tests
```

### API Rate Limits

The PubMed API has rate limits:
- **Without API key**: 3 requests per second
- **With API key**: 10 requests per second

For better performance and reliability:
1. Register for an NCBI account and get an API key
2. Provide your email address when using the tool
3. Use the `--api-key` option or set it programmatically
